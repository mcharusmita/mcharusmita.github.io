  <h3> <strong>  New Yorker's Minimum Wage Future </strong><br/><font size="3">By Giselle Vanegas</font></h3>

  <font face="Calibri Italic" size="-1"> Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said that in his State of the State he will propose making the minimum wage in New York among the highest in the country. <strong> Credit Victor J. Blue for The New York Times.</strong></font></span></p>
    <p>The minimum wage rate is the lowest hourly amount that can be paid to employees.</p>
	<p>New York&rsquo;s minimum wage has risen from $8 to $8.75 an hour, giving a boost in pay to some 700,000 workers.</p>
	<p>The state is one of several raising its minimum pay rate in the new year, with increases taking effect Jan. 1 in Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, Florida and other states.New York lawmakers approved the increase in 2013 as part of a series of steps to bring the wage to $9 on Dec. 31, 2015.</p>
	<p><span class="co"><a href="http://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/state-minimum-wage-chart.aspx"><img src="minimumwage.png" /></a></span></p>
    <p>It could go up even higher if lawmakers pass another increase in the 2015 legislative session.Supporters of a higher minimum wage are calling for a $10.10-per-hour minimum and want to give cities like New York the authority to raise it even more.</p>
	<p>	Continuing to push for higher wages for the state's lowest-paid workers, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced on Tuesday that all of the waiters, waitresses and others who work for tips in New YorkCity will soon get a raise of their minimum wage to $7.50 an hour. The state last increased the minimum wage in 2013, approving a three-year rollout that pushed the hourly rate to $8.75 from $7.25. That wage will rise to $9 an hour by 2016. But , Mr. Cuomo suggested that the rate of increase was too slow, saying “the wage gap has continued to increase.” Under his proposal, the wage would increase to $11.50 and $10.50 at the end of 2016.</p>
    <p>
The proposal, announced at a news conference in Manhattan, seemingly offered the governor a chance to refine his position regarding differing wages in differing parts of the state, noting it was the first time New York City would be allowed a different rate. Last year, Mr. Cuomo had dismissed suggestions that local governments could set their own minimum wages, saying that letting them do so could lead to a “chaotic situation.
